Module 5: Managing images and deployments using the Windows ADK

Lab A: Preparing the imaging and Windows PE environment
Exercise 1: Configuring a custom Windows PE environment

Task 1: Set up the Windows PE build environment
1. On CM1, open the Start menu, expand Windows Kits, right-click Deployment and Imaging Tools Environment, click More, and then click Run as administrator.
2. In the Administrator: Deployment and Imaging Tools Environment window, create the directory
structure by typing the following command, and then pressing Enter:
Copype amd64 C:\Winpe64
3. Minimize the Deployment and Imaging Tools Environment window.
4. Click File Explorer on the taskbar.
5. In the navigation pane, expand Allfiles (C:), expand WinPE64, expand Media, and then click Sources.
Note: Note the size of the Boot.wim file. It will be 239,002 kilobytes (KB).
6. Close File Explorer.

Task 2: Mount the base Windows PE image
Note: To avoid syntax errors, copy and paste the commands into the Windows PowerShell
command prompt from the E:\Labfiles\Mod05\Mod05_DISM_Powershell.txt file.
1. Click Start and then click the Windows PowerShell tile.
Note: The version of DISM installed with Windows ADK for Windows 10 is not the same as
the version in the default Windows PowerShell console. You must add the correct DISM module
for the current version of Windows ADK.
2. In the Administrator: Windows PowerShell window, type the following cmdlet, and then press
Enter:
Import-Module "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Assessment and Deployment
Kit\Deployment Tools\amd64\DISM"
3. In the Administrator: Windows PowerShell window, mount the Boot.wim image by typing the
following command, and then pressing Enter:
Mount-WindowsImage –ImagePath E:\Winpe64\Media\Sources\Boot.wim –Index 1 –Path
E:\Winpe64\Mount

Task 3: Add drivers and optional components to the Windows PE image
1. To add the Microsoft Hyper-V drivers to the Windows PE image, type the following command, and then press Enter:
Add-WindowsDriver –Path E:\winpe64\mount –Driver E:\Software\Drivers\HyperVx64 -Recurse -ForceUnsigned
Note: The third-party drivers you injected into the image will be listed. Confirm that the
last one on the list has a Published Name of oem9.inf.

2. To add support for the Windows PowerShell command-line interface to the Windows PE image, type
the following commands, and then press Enter after each:
CD “C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Assessment and Deployment kit\Windows
preInstallation Environment\amd64\WinPE_OCs”

Add-WindowsPackage –Path E:\winpe64\mount –PackagePath .\WinPE-NetFX.cab
Add-WindowsPackage –Path E:\winpe64\mount –PackagePath .\WinPE-Scripting.cab
Add-WindowsPackage –Path E:\winpe64\mount –PackagePath .\WinPE-WMI.cab
Add-WindowsPackage –Path E:\winpe64\mount –PackagePath .\WinPE-PowerShell.cab
Add-WindowsPackage –Path E:\winpe64\mount –PackagePath .\WinPE-DismCmdlets.cab

Note: Each Add-WindowsPackage cmdlet might take several minutes.
Note: To avoid syntax errors, copy and paste the commands from the
E:\Labfiles\Mod05\Mod05_DISM_Powershell.txt file into the Windows PowerShell
command prompt.

Task 4: Save changes and dismount the image
1. Commit the changes to the Windows PE image by typing the following command, and then pressing
Enter:
Dismount-WindowsImage –Path E:\winpe64\mount –Save

2. Use File Explorer to view the contents of the E:\Winpe64\media\Sources folder. Note the new size
of the Boot.wim file.

3. Close File Explorer and Windows PowerShell.

Task 5: Create Windows PE Media

1. To create an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) image of the Boot.wim that you can
use to create boot media, restore the Deployment and Imaging Tools Environment window, and
then run the following commands, pressing Enter after each command:
MD E:\BootISO
MakeWinpeMedia /iso E:\Winpe64 E:\BootISO\WinPEx64.iso

2. Use File Explorer to open the E:\BootISO folder, and then ensure that the WinPEx64.iso file was
created.
Results: After completing this exercise, you should have customized the Windows Preinstallation
Environment (Windows PE) image and created an .iso file of the image.

Task 6: Prepare for the next lab
Leave the virtual machines running for the next lab. Do not revert.
